                 <h3>🥑 About Avocados</h3>
                 <p>You're right about being careful with avocados! On a Low FODMAP diet, you can only have very small amounts (1/8 of an avocado). For your IBS, it's safer to skip it completely in sushi or ask for just a tiny bit.</p>

                 <h3>🪄 Now lets order like a Smartie together!</h3>
                 <p><em>Lets say the magic words together!</em></p>

                     <li>Specify <strong>"no mayo-based sauces pwess"</strong></li>
                     <li>Ask for <strong>"no cream cheese pwesss"</strong></li>
                     <li>Say <strong>"no onion or garlic in sauces pwesss"</strong></li>
                     <li>If able, ask for non-dairy alternatives. (Oat milk, lactose free dairy, Soy milk)</li>
                 </ul>
                 <p><em>Those are yummy for your tum tum and it wont get hurt!</em></p>

                <h3>Thalassemia (Moderate)</h3>
                <p>Thalassemia can affect relationships in several ways, as it may require ongoing care and attention. People living with moderate thalassemia may feel fatigued and unwell frequently, making it harder to engage in social activities, work, or personal relationships.</p>
                <h4>How It Affects Relationships:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Physical Limitations:</strong> The constant fatigue and need for rest can affect social interactions, as you might have to cancel plans or limit your activities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Emotional Strain:</strong> The chronic nature of the illness can sometimes lead to feelings of isolation or frustration, which may strain relationships if others don't fully understand the condition.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dependence:</strong> You might feel dependent on others for physical support, which can sometimes cause feelings of guilt or frustration in relationships. However, I’m always here to offer support and remind you that there’s no burden in asking for help when you need it.</li>
                </ul>
